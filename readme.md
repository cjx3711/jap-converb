# Jap Converb

This is a web application that can conjugate any japanese verb (hopefully) using the rules of conjugation.
A live example can be found here.

## Libraries / Dependencies
- [Wakakana](http://wanakana.com/) - Romaji - Kana conversion library
- [Jisho API](http://jisho.org/forum/54fefc1f6e73340b1f160000-is-there-any-kind-of-search-api) - For dictionary results

## Structure
The application is coded in jQuery / Bootstrap.
The backend framework is running on PHP.
Currently, all the code is in a single file.

> Note: There is no reason that the program is in php. It is only so because it happens to be the laguage I was most famaliar with at that time.

## Todo
1. Split up the files, give a proper folder structure.
1. Add a lesson / learning page.
1. Move away from php (maybe?).
